# Cookie Session V2 Grails Plugin

The Cookie Session V2 plugin allows grails applications to store session data in cookies. By storing session data
in cookies, a complete record of a client's state is transmitted with each request from client to server.
This allows the application to be completely stateless and thus support drastically simplified scaling architectures and
robust fault tolerance.

## Simplified Scaling
After installing the cookie session v2 plugin, application scaled by starting instances 
of the application and routing requests requests to them. No clustering configuration, session replication or sticky sessions needed.

## Fault Tolerance
In the event an application instance or its server becomes unavailable, other application instances
are able to service the requests. If only a single instance of an application is deployed, it can be brought
down and up again without loosing clients' sessions because sessions are restored on each request. A side affect of this
architecture is that applications can be upgraded without dropping clients sessions. 

## Relationship to grails-cookie-session plugin
This project started as a fix to the grails-cookie-session plugin. However after
sorting through architectural issues and attempting to fix the code so that it supported my use-cases, the
project became a complete rewrite. With that said, this project would not have been possible (or at least would have
taken much longer!) had it not been for the original work. Many thanks to Masatoshi Hayashi
for giving me a place to start.

## Supported Use-cases
the driving motivation for this plugin, was to use cookie-based session with full support for the following
+ flash scope
+ webflow
+ secure session
+ sessions larger than 8kb

## Secure Sessions
this plugin can be configured to encrypt the serialized session stored in the cookie. This feature prevents
clients from accessing or tampering with potentially sensitive data being stored in the session.

## Example

Config.groovy

    grails.plugin.cookiesession.enabled = true
    grails.plugin.cookiesession.encryptcookie = true
    grails.plugin.cookiesession.cryptoalgorithm = "Blowfish"
    grails.plugin.cookiesession.secret = "This is my secret. There are many like it, but this one is mine.".bytes
    grails.plugin.cookiesession.cookiecount = 10
    grails.plugin.cookiesession.maxcookiesize = 2048  // 2kb
    grails.plugin.cookiesession.sessiontimeout = 3600 // one hour
    grails.plugin.cookiesession.cookiename = 'gsession'

### Enabling large session
To enable large sessions, you'll need to increase the max http header size of the tomcat connector. In tomcat, this can be configured in the server.xml with the maxHttpHeaderSize. Set this value to something large such as 262144 (i.e. 256kb). 

When developing in grails, you can configure the embedded tomcat instance with the tomcat startup event.
1.  create the file scripts/_Events.groovy in your project directory
2.  add the following code:

    eventConfigureTomcat = {tomcat ->
      tomcat.connector.setAttribute("maxHttpHeaderSize",262144)
    }

If you're using a container other than tomcat, refer product documentation to figure out what the maximum http header size is and how to increase it.

### Enabling webflow hibernate session
In order for webflows attached to hibernate sessions to be correctly deserialized, some additional configuration is needed. The following instructions show
how to explicitly name the hibernate session factory.  
1.  create the hibernate.cfg.xml file: grails create-hibernate-cfg-xml
2.  edit the grails-app/conf/hibernate/hibernate.cfg.xml file and the hibernate.session_factory_name property under the session-factory element

    <hibernate-configuration>
      <session-factory>
        <property name="hibernate.session_factory_name">session_factory</property>
      </session-factory>
    </hibernate-configuration>
